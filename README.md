# Cost-Estimation-Model
This task involved building a cost estimation model for a year 6 to 8 online writing tool in New Zealand using assumptions in Excel.

Cost Estimation Model for an AI-Powered Online Writing Tool (Years 6–8, New Zealand)

This project develops a cost estimation model to forecast the monthly operational costs of an AI-powered online writing tool used by Year 6–8 students in New Zealand. Using realistic assumptions on student population, engagement rates, session frequency, and language usage, the model estimates token-based AI inference costs (input and output) alongside NLP syntax analysis costs. The final output provides a transparent, scalable cost breakdown to support budgeting and decision-making for educational technology deployment.

📊 Detailed Project Description (Strong for Recruiters)
Project Overview
This project involved building a cost estimation model in Excel to assess the monthly operating costs of an online AI-assisted writing tool designed for Year 6–8 students in New Zealand. The model combines user behavior assumptions with AI pricing metrics to estimate total costs at scale.

Key Assumptions
Total students: 120,000 (40,000 per year group)
Active user ratio: 80%
Average usage: 10 sessions per student per month
Total monthly sessions: 960,000
Increasing language complexity across year levels, reflected in higher input/output token usage

Cost Components Modeled
AI Input Token Costs
Based on Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite pricing per 1M tokens
AI Output Token Costs
Scaled by expected response length per session
NLP Syntax Analysis Costs
Calculated using character-based pricing per 1,000 characters

Key Results
Total monthly input tokens: 432 million
Total monthly output tokens: 216 million
Total monthly characters analyzed: 1.73 billion
Estimated total monthly cost: $345.60

Value of the Model
Demonstrates cost forecasting at scale
Highlights how user behavior impacts AI operational costs
Provides a transparent, adjustable framework for scenario analysis
Suitable for budget planning, pricing strategy, and product feasibility analysis

Skills Demonstrated
Cost modeling & assumptions design
Usage-based forecasting
Translating technical pricing into business insights
